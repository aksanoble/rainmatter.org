Rainmatter Foundation is an initiative by the people behind [Zerodha](https://zerodha.com).
We realise that climate change is the biggest existential threat to life as we know it,
and we have committed to using the resources available to us to enable, and to attempt 
to replicate at scale, the potential solutions that may help address at least some of 
these threats, and aid in the restoration of our natural ecosystems.

We are a non-profit that aims to support grassroots individuals and organisations 
engaged in solving these problems, as well as startups working on entrepreneurship 
that helps scale ideas around in the space. Our focus is in the directions of afforestation, 
ecological restoration, fostering distributed and federated green economies and livelihoods.

If you are experienced or passionate about this space and would like to work with us, [write to us](mailto:info@rainmatter.org).
