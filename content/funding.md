## Startups 

We not only think climate change is an urgent and critical issue to address, but that businesses and economies need to align with this direction. That there is an opportunity for smart entrepreneurs to create businesses around this that are profitable and have positive impacts on the planet.

We invest in startups working in this area via our investment company, <a href="https://rainmatter.com">Rainmatter Capital</a>. If you are a startup or organisation working in this area and are looking for funding, [write to us](mailto:info@rainmatter.org).

## Grants

Many small organizations and teams do amazing work in that is forward looking, or around advocacy, policy, research that does not necessarily appeal to traditional CSR funding. We believe that it is important to pursue these small efforts and aim at enabling and supporting such organizations and teams with grants ranging from ₹2 to ₹10 lakhs with up to 3 years of commitment.

If you would like to apply for a grant, [write to us](mailto:info@rainmatter.org).
