## **Our focus Areas**

- **Rewilding - More Forest Everywhere** — Your organization works on or encourages direct rewilding of spaces, or encourages better soil management and biodiversity at farms, in public spaces and the commons inturn making every space a little more forest-like.
  
- **Ecosystem Conservation and Restoration** — Your organization works on air pollution, responsible water management at any scale, public transport and NMT, and similar domains that address ecological issues.
  
- **Localized Production and Consumption** — Your organization helps with the adoption of more local consumption, production and livelihoods creation around this, especially with a greater amount of production and value created outside of tier-I cities.

At Rainmatter Foundation, we believe that these are important directions to pursue over time and would like to enable and support such organizations and teams to continue their work on spaces that are part of our circle of concern, across projects and ideas, and with sustained focus over time. Progress made in these directions would include a deeper understanding of the problem space, helping involve more stakeholders and bringing the ideas to a larger mainstream, and arriving at approaches and solutions for various problems through experimentation.

## **Organizational grants**

CSR Funding typically tends to be focused on short to medium-term projects. At Rainmatter we are focused on longer-term outcomes that help create a low footprint, sustainable ecosystems that achieve a balance along the ecological, economic and social indicator dimensions. We believe that in the pursuit of these goals, organizations should have space and flexibility to experiment with ideas, and while short term project goals are useful, they should not get in the way of the overall goals. We are also eager to work with organizations that collaborate easily across the board and help adopt and adapt good ideas and best practices through cross-pollination. If you are one such organization and you relate to the focus area listed above, please share the charter and background of your organization, a summary of your work, and directions you are pursuing that need funding without short term project goals and focus [here](mailto:info@rainmatter.org) and we will be in touch.

## **Small grants**

You might be an organization that is upcoming and working on the focus areas listed above. Your work could involve direct efforts in the above, or advocacy and education or creation of tools and methods to increase participation and involve a larger mainstream in these efforts. Depending on the work you are doing in the space, we have also designed a small grant program where the Rainmatter Foundation will fund you for a 3 year period with a grant. If you are one such organization and you relate to the focus area listed above, please share the charter and background of your organization, a summary of your work, and directions you are pursuing that need funding without short term project goals and focus [here](mailto:info@rainmatter.org) and we will be in touch.

## Fellowships

We also offer fellowships to candidates working on the focus areas listed. Once again, our focus is on a 3-year timeframe and goals that you chase over that period. We like ideas with a bias to action and real change on the ground that can then go into playbooks that are replicable elsewhere. To apply, please share your resume, summary of your work, and directions you are pursuing that need funding without short term project goals and focus [here](mailto:info@rainmatter.org) and we will be in touch.

For both organizational and small grants program as well as the fellowships we would require quarterly updates on the efforts, ideas, projects and other efforts that have been undertaken at your end and will release the next year’s grant based on our assessment of the same. We will also include you on our internal and public platforms for showcasing your work, seeking help and collaborations to grow the ideas you are working on, and helping others with theirs.

## Investments

We not only think climate change is an urgent and critical issue to address, but that businesses and economies need to align with this direction. That there is an opportunity for smart entrepreneurs to create businesses around this that are profitable and have positive impacts on the planet.

We invest in startups working in this area via our investment company, Rainmatter Capital. If you are a startup or organisation working in this area looking for funding, [apply here](https://forms.gle/88D9cKMan27qa5R57) and we will get in touch with you.
