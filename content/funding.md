## Startups 

We not only think climate change is an urgent and critical issue to address, but that businesses and economies need to align with this direction. That there is an opportunity for smart entrepreneurs to create businesses around this that are profitable and have positive impacts on the planet.

We invest in startups working in this area via our investment company, <a href="https://rainmatter.com">Rainmatter Capital</a>. If you are a startup or organisation working in this area and are looking for funding, introduce your organisation [on the forum](https://grove.rainmatter.org/c/funding/6) and we will get in touch with you.
