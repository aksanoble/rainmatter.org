  description: Dr. K S Gopal is a pioneer who is driving an experiment for the ecologically sound planting of flora on a couple of kilometers of medians on main roads in Bengaluru. The aim is to support an ecosystem for birds and bees, use 50% less water, drastically bring down truck and road closure time, reduce costs for de-weeding, create biologically-rich healthy soils and reduce the probability of plant diseases. We hope this forms the template for urban arterial roads one day.
