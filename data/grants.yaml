  description: NCF contributes to the knowledge and conservation of India’s unique wildlife heritage with innovative research and imaginative solutions. They work in a range of wildlife habitats—from coral reefs and tropical rainforests to the high mountains of the Himalayas. They strive to understand the survival needs of endangered species such as snow leopards and elephants, as well as equally fascinating but lesser-known wildlife such as corals and spiders. Their research also addresses human resource use and its impacts on wild species and ecosystems. Using this knowledge of wildlife ecology and human society, they design conservation strategies that are locally appropriate. These are implemented in collaboration with local communities who depend the most on natural resources, and the governments that manage them. While promoting wildlife conservation, their programmes also strive to safeguard livelihood and development options for local communities.
