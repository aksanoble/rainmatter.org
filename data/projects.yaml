  description: A 100+ acre farmers’ collective at the edge of the Bandipur forest aims to not only green and water enrich a currently degraded landscape, but also strengthen the livelihoods of farmers there through an agroforestry approach as a collective. We were delighted to come across Malvikaa's efforts and decided to support her plans for the duration of the 3 years they would need support for the completion of the project.

As part of this, we have contributed to their "Wild Shaale" program—a unique conservation-education program designed for rural school-going children living around wildlife reserves. It builds foundational knowledge about local wildlife, ecosystems, and conservation issues, fostering tolerance for wildlife and nurturing these children as future stewards of conservation.

- name: Ecologically Sustainable Median Planting @ Center for Environment Concerns

  description: Dr. K S Gopal is a pioneer who is driving an experiment for the ecologically sound planting of flora on a couple of kilometers of medians on main roads in Bengaluru to help support an ecosystem for birds and bees, use 50% less water, drastically bring down truck and road closure time, reduce costs for de-weeding, create biologically rich healthy soils, and reduce the probability of plant diseases. We  hope it might one day form the template for our roads becoming much greener ecologically.
